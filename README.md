## Assembling Guide
> For your reference

1. Plan placement of all the components.
2. Drill (4) mounting holes for motor brackets.
3. Attach a motor to a bracket, secure motor bracket to the bed with nuts and bolts. Repeat for the other motor.
4. Assemble wheel rims and tires.
5. Attach wheel assembly to the motor shafts.
6. Attach battery holder to the bed. **Make sure the switch is at the `OFF` position**.
7. Attach wire splitter to the bed and open the (6) levers.
8. Plug the battery wires to the 2 channels end of the wire splitter then shut the levers. **One wire in each slot**.
9. Plug M1 and M2 wires to the 4 channels end of the wire splitter then close the levers.
10. Attach the caster wheel to the bottom of the bed.
11. Check short circuit before battery plugged in.
12. Place (2) 18650 batteries in the battery holder.
13. **Make sure nothing is contacting any tire**. Hold the base in hand and flip the battery switch to `ON`.
14. Observe the directions of the wheels. If not as expected, adjust wiring until satisfied.

Have fun roving!
